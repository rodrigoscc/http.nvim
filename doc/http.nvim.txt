==============================================================================
1. http.nvim                                          *http.nvim*

`http.nvim` lets you run HTTP requests from Neovim, manage environments and
run hooks before and after each request.

FEATURES                                      *http.nvim-features*

- Store multiple requests in a `.http` file
- Search project requests with Telescope
- Run project requests with Telescope
- Manage multiple environments per project
- Declare global or request-scoped variables in the `.http` file
- Run last request run for easier iteration
- Declare before and after hooks for each request
- Autocomplete variables with cmp
- Inspect variables current value
- Lualine component to show current environment

INSTALLATION                                      *http.nvim-installation*

Install the plugin with your preferred plugin manager:

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "rodrigoscc/http.nvim",
        config = function()
            require("http-nvim").setup()
        end,
        dependencies = {
            "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
            "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim"
        },
    }
<

  Note: http.nvim uses a Tree-sitter grammar that is not yet included in nvim-treesitter. When loading this plugin the default `http` grammar is replaced with this: <https://github.com/rodrigoscc/tree-sitter-http2>. This grammar provides features that aren't available in the default grammar.

CONFIGURATION                                      *http.nvim-configuration*

Default configuration ~

>lua
    {
        ---Http files must be stored in this directory for http.nvim to find them
        http_dir = ".http",
        ---File that contains the hooks to be executed before and after each request.
        ---This file will be inside the directory defined by `http_dir`.
        hooks_file = "hooks.lua",
	---File that contains each project environment. This file will
	---be inside the directory defined by `http_dir`.
        environments_file = "environments.json",
        ---File that contains each of the projects active environment
        active_envs_file = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/http/envs.json",
	---Window config for the response window. Refer to :help nvim_open_win for the available keys.
	win_config = { split = "below" },
    }

BASIC USAGE                                                  *http.nvim-basic-usage*

Create a new `.http` file inside the `.http` directory of your project (e.g. `.http/requests.http`). Write your request in the file, and run it with `:Http run_closest`.

>http
    POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "title": "foo",
        "body": "bar",
        "userId": 1
    }
<

Have multiple requests in a single file by separating them with a line containing only `###`.

>http
    @request.title = Create a post
    POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "title": "foo",
        "body": "bar",
        "userId": 1
    }

    ###

    @request.title = Get all posts
    GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
<

Run a request from anywhere in your project with `:Http run`. Filter the requests by the `request.title`, if defined, or by the request start line.

VARIABLES                                                  *http.nvim-variables*

Variables are available anywhere below the line they were declared. Variables that start with `request.` are request-scoped and are only available in the request they were declared in.

Example:
>http
    @request.title = Create a post
    @userId = 1
    POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "title": "foo",
        "body": "bar",
        "userId": {{userId}}
    }
<

RESERVED REQUEST-SCOPED VARIABLES ~

>vim
    request.title       The title of the request. Generally used to search and run the request directly.
    request.after_hook  The hook function name to run after the request completes.
    request.before_hook The hook function name to run before the request completes.
    request.curl_flags	Additional flags to include in the generated curl command.
<

HOOKS                                                        *http.nvim-hooks*

Hooks are declared in a separate Lua file, for easier maintenance and reuse. Enter the hooks file with `:Http open_hooks` and declare your hooks in the file. It's required for you to return the functions you want to use as hooks.

>lua
    local show_result = require("http-nvim.hooks_utils").show
    local update_env = require("http-nvim.hooks_utils").update_env

    local function ask_for_confirmation(request, start_request)
        local confirmation =
            vim.fn.input("Are you sure you want to run this request? [y/N] ")

        if confirmation == "y" or confirmation == "Y" then
            start_request()
        end
    end

    local function save_access_token(request, response, stdout)
        show_result(request, response)

        if response.status_code ~= 200 then
            return
        end

        update_env({
            access_token = response.body.access_token,
            refresh_token = response.body.refresh_token,
        })
    end

    return {
        save_access_token = save_access_token,
        ask_for_confirmation = ask_for_confirmation,
    }
<

>http
    @request.title = Login
    @request.before_hook = ask_for_confirmation
    @request.after_hook = save_access_token
    POST {{api_url}}/login
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "username": "{{username}}",
        "password": "{{password}}"
    }
<

The above, once the `Login` request is run, will ask for confirmation and then update the environment with the access and refresh token if a 200 status code is returned.

Hooks signature ~

`before_hook` has the following signature:
>lua
    function(request: http.Request, run_request: function(): nil): nil
<

`after_hook` has the following signature:
>lua
    function(request: http.Request, response: http.Response, raw: http.Raw): nil
<

where `http.Request`, `http.Response` and `http.Raw` are defined as:
>lua
    ---@class http.Request
    ---@field method string
    ---@field url string
    ---@field query string?
    ---@field node TSNode
    ---@field local_context table
    ---@field source http.Source

    ---@class http.Response
    ---@field ok boolean
    ---@field status_code number
    ---@field status_line string
    ---@field headers table
    ---@field body string
    ---@field total_time number?

    ---@class http.Raw
    ---@field command string[]
    ---@field output string[]
<

Hooks utils ~

You can require a module called `http-nvim.hooks_utils` to use the functions provided by http.nvim in your hooks. The available functions are:

- `show(request, response, output)`: Show the response.
- `update_env(override_variables)`: Update the current environment with the given variables.
- `run_request(title, override_variables)`: Run the request with the given title and override variables.

ENVIRONMENTS                                                  *http.nvim-environments*

Environments hold variables that are available to all requests in the project. To create a new environment, run `:Http create_env`. A `.json` file will be opened with each environment variables. For instance, the following environments file has the `local` and `staging` environments.

>json
    {
        "local": {
            "password": "password123",
            "username": "localuser",
            "api_url": "http://localhost:3000"
        },
        "staging": {
            "password": "password456",
            "username": "staginguser",
            "api_url": "https://staging.api.com"
        }
    }
<

Then, select an environment with `:Http select_env`. Now, all the variables in the environment will be available to all requests.

Lualine component ~

Use our Lualine component to show the active environment in your statusline.

>lua
    require("lualine").setup({
        sections = {
            lualine_a = { require("http-nvim").http_env_lualine_component },
        },
    })
<
